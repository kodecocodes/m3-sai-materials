/**
`FeaturedCollectionEntityQuery` allows people to query the app for trail collections through a Find intent in the Shortcuts app,
automatically providing filtering options based on the entity's properties â€” without the complexity of an `EntityPropertyQuery.`
In this sample, the featured trail collections is a fixed list, and `TrailCollection` only has a small number of properties, making
it a good choice for this query API. Large data sets, or entity types that require more memory, should use `EntityPropertyQuery`.

`SuggestSessions` takes the output of the Find intent that this query creates, and uses it as an input.
